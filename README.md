## How to Run Locally
To run the project locally, you have two options:

1. **Using a local server**: Put the files from the `dist` folder on your host server. If you have PHP installed, you can navigate to the `/dist` directory and run the following command to start a local server:
   ```
   php -S localhost:8080
   ```
   This will make the project accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Using Vite**: If you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed, you can run the following command to start the project using Vite:
   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
   This will start a development server and automatically open your project in a browser.

Choose the option that best suits your needs and start working with Vinyl locally.
